Yeah, you heard me. Street crews\u2026 yes, those same folks your racist uncle thinks are the final boss in a Fox News fever dream\u2026 are now escorting immigrants to court like chivalrous vigilantes in Nike tech fleece. Because when the state decides the Constitution is optional and ICE turns into a roaming death squad with a mask and a clipboard, sometimes the only due process you get is five dudes in matching hoodies telling the feds, \u201cNah, bro. Not today.\u201d And guess what? It works. Because ICE agents will happily snatch a grandma from a church picnic if she makes a good deportation stat\u2026 but put them near anyone who doesn\u2019t say \u201cyes, sir\u201d with a trembling voice and suddenly they remember they have \u201cother priorities.\u201d These federalized cosplay commandos without badges (but definitely daddy issues) don\u2019t go after the dangerous\u2026 they go after the docile. Why? Because they\u2019re not enforcers of law\u2026 they\u2019re mall cops with militarized toys and the moral compass of a broken Etch A Sketch. So of course ICE targets \u201cassimilated immigrants with families.\u201d Because God forbid we deport a white-collar CEO laundering cartel money in Miami\u2026 nah, better to rip a kid from his dad in front of the school, then call it \u201cborder security.\u201d These aren\u2019t agents\u2026 they\u2019re cowards in windbreakers playing hide-and-seek with the American Dream. And meanwhile, the gangs\u2026 yes, gangs\u2026 have done what Congress won\u2019t: form a coalition to protect vulnerable people from a government that thinks \u201ccompassion\u201d is a foreign threat. These guys just unionized against fascism faster than the Democratic Party could agree on brunch. So let\u2019s be real. If you\u2019re more outraged that gang members are helping immigrants than you are that the government is hunting them like they\u2019re Pok\u00e9mon with poor English, you\u2019re not patriotic\u2026 you\u2019re complicit. You\u2019re the spiritual lovechild of George Wallace and a Ring doorbell, screaming \u201claw and order\u201d while your empathy dies in 4K. ICE isn\u2019t about safety. It\u2019s about optics. It\u2019s about keeping middle America scared shitless so they don\u2019t realize who\u2019s actually robbing them blind: it\u2019s not Jos\u00e9 from Oaxaca, it\u2019s Jeff from JPMorgan. So props to the homies rolling deep to immigration court. Because while Congress filibusters itself into irrelevance and ICE roleplays as apartheid cosplay, someone\u2019s actually showing up for justice. You call it gang violence. I call it community defense. And if that scares you? That\u2019s not fear. That\u2019s your conscience trying to escape the prison you built out of denial. Let it out. Or stay silent\u2026 and history will remember you the same way it remembers the cowards: not at all.

(1:25:50) Bret keeps telling Lindsay that he doesn't understand what he is talking about and advises him to clean up his \"errors.\" Lindsay dismisses his concerns. The three seem to be unaware of how white liberals turn all good concepts into quasi-religious nonsense and form cults around them, or that men further to the right of them politically will eventually censor their \"nuanced intellectual dark web\" speech too. The zealots can't see the zealotry in themselves. Lindsay calls \"the woke right\" a form of \"neo-Marxism.\" Lindsay only refers to the Communist Manifesto an never quotes Das Kapital or other writings. Lindsay is just another example of centrist, pro-establishment men who haven't read much Marx calling everything they don't like or understand \"Neo-Marxism.\" I'm glad someone is intervening before Lindsay's cult following grows too large.

{"clean_text": "Zionists say that \"the far left are the real Nazis\", which is the exact same thing the Fascists/Nazis in the West say (\"the far left are the real totalitarians!!!\"). In both cases this (false) argument is used to justify authoritarian repression from their own side. Zionists complain at being victims of \"racism\"/\"antisemitism\" while then saying that they should be allowed to be racist or that they're not racist when they say clearly racist things (this is the exact same thing Fascists/Nazis/WN in the West say regarding people being \"anti-Yte\" and themselves being anti-POC). It is the classic \"I'm allowed to be racist, but you're not\". Zionists claim that Jews who are not Zionist or not pro-Israel are disloyal, just like Fascists/Nazis/WN say that anti-Zionist Jews are anti-West for not being Fascists/Nazis/WN like them. This is a version of the \"dual-loyalty\" trope. Zionists want Jews to go to Israel, just like Fascists/Nazis/WN want Jews to go to Israel. This is \"blood and soil\"/\"racial purity\". I could go on and on. This entire thing is just a repeat of the Eastern European (Zionist) vs. Western European (Assimilationist) inter-Jewish conflict. Who was behind the Eastern European Jewish proclivity to support Zionism? Antisemitic authoritarian totalitarians in Russia. Which side do you think the historical Nazis supported in the 30's? The Eastern European Zionists. Which ideology did many of the original Zionist militias/terror-groups support while fighting in Palestine? Fascism. Which ideology did these same groups switch to supporting once the Fascists/Nazis were on the decline? Stalinism. At every turn, Zionists expose their authoritarian tendencies, their racism (both internalized and externalized), their anti-humanism, their anti-democratic views etc...

{"clean_text": "It still feels quite uncomfortable to ever address the topic of race, because I am a white person and historically my work around for that has simply been to self segregate so I can go \u201cI\u2019m never racist\u201d while conviently omitting it\u2019s because I actively try to avoid any situation where I might get called out for something that is. It\u2019s like saying \u201cI never lose at soccer\u201d while excluding that it\u2019s because I never play soccer in the first place. That statement is only correct on a technicality, and saying it is just posturing how good I am without actually knowing how good I really am. I benefit from the soft segregation that still very much exists in the US, in that it allows me to never have to learn in what ways I could and probably am racist, even if being racist isn\u2019t something I\u2019d intentionally want to do. I can choose to protect myself from ever feeling bad about being racist, because I can choose to never discover how I might be to ever have to work on it. Cool, I have identified and acknowledged I\u2019m scared of being seen as a bad guy, even if part of it is also genuinely wanting to avoid making others uncomfortable by accidentally being the bad guy. All I\u2019m really doing about it though is very occasionally passively enjoying POC creators and watching myself a tad more/paying a little more attention around POC who just happen to be around me (and that\u2019s if I realize they are, because it\u2019s limited to online interactions where race can largely go unnoticed). This can eventually lead to improvements, abit slowly, it\u2019s a start. Though I\u2019m still falling into colorblind racism. As I said at the start, it still feels quite uncomfortable to ever address the topic of race, and I am anxious ever putting my two cents in on anything touching upon it out of fear I might be told to sit down and shut up. I do not know how to act normal about race, and knowing I don\u2019t leads me to psyche myself out of learning how to get comfortable with it. I am assuming every POC in existence is going to be nasty towards me if I screw up, instead of trusting any of them to be understanding and patient about it to a reasonable degree. I am white guilt tripping myself into being afraid of POC, which is in fact the opposite of learning to get comfortable around other races. I\u2019m not quite sure what to really do though, because I\u2019m not sure how to familiarize myself with POC and their plights in a way that doesn\u2019t just feel like \u201ccollecting\u201d a more diverse roster of company, tokenizing. I\u2019m not sure what is or isn\u2019t tokenizing behavior, basically. I\u2019m hesitant to ask, because that requires me to admit I don\u2019t know to those I\u2019m afraid of upsetting with the question. I\u2019m more concerned with looking like I didn\u2019t do my independent reaserch enough vs just fucking asking for someone else\u2019s opinion. I want to fix that, so here\u2019s a stupid amount of words to ultimately ask; can someone not white reassure my ass it\u2019s understandable to be a little awkward about something society does make taboo, and if there\u2019s anything I could be doing to be less awkward about it so I can maybe actually be helpful instead of merely trying to be inoffensive?", "mentions": [], "hashtags": [], "links": [], "emojis": [], "emoji_names": [], "id": "114734765878115258"}

{"clean_text": "One of anthropology\u2019s great cautionary tales involves the American anthropologist Margaret Mead. Mead travelled to Samoa in the 1920s and described in her book Coming of Age in Samoa a society totally free of the Western world\u2019s sexual taboos, to its great benefit. The book captivated Western audiences and seemed to suggest a happy alternative to our damaging complexes and hangups, a world of joyful love and sex without guilt and shame \u2014 until it was revealed, decades later, by Derek Freeman, that Mead\u2019s informants had been systematically lying to her about their sexual lives because she was an outsider and a woman. The whole thing was a dream. Mead\u2019s Samoa didn\u2019t exist and never had. Critics of liberalism and multiculturalism, especially critics of the postmodern variety, see them both as a kind of Western imperialism, whilst denying that they are such. These people are right. Presented as neutral political and interpretive frames that allow the world\u2019s great multitude of peoples to live happily side by side and \u201cbe who they really are\u201d in peace and harmony, liberalism and multiculturalism are nothing of the sort. They smuggle in values, not least of all a commitment to moral universalism, to individual over group, to law over custom, that are utterly partial in their origin and force, and to which the vast majority of people throughout history have not subscribed and probably couldn\u2019t even if they wanted to. The multicultural experiment forced on Britain and other Western nations by their ruling classes is not a genuine encounter with the Other. It\u2019s a dangerous fantasy, a delusion of shared humanity that ends in disaster. We\u2019ve been told these people are just like us, though they may wear a different skin colour and worship a different god \u2014 but they\u2019re not.

I spent most of my life just waiting for things to get better, and it\u2019s still something I do far too often. It\u2019s a learned helplessness. You\u2019re not helpless, you\u2019re just oppressed. I wasn\u2019t and still aren\u2019t helpless, but there\u2019s still ways I\u2019m oppressed. It\u2019s just that age isn\u2019t one of them anymore, and life did improve once it was lifted and I could leave my home. It never had to be that way. I don\u2019t want you to ever think it had to be like this, even if it fucking hurts to acknowledge\u2026 Because the way things are is harmful, and that shouldn\u2019t be ignored and forgotten once it finally gets easier. There shouldn\u2019t be a comfort in the familiar pain, because we\u2019re in fucking pain and no one does shit about it. Those who try get hurt worse. It\u2019s the rightful fucking anger I had when I was younger, and finally being able to breath made me hesitant to truly look back on it once I found my own personal peace. Others cannot have that peace right now and others may never find it because they either never found an opportunity to heal or they fucking killed themselves over it. I can\u2019t do much on a grand scale as an individual but I sure as shit can tell others they\u2019re not the only ones who think it\u2019s fucked. It isn\u2019t just the youth who think it, it\u2019s not childish fantasy to expect more, it\u2019s not unfounded teenage rebellion to feel so wronged and broken. It is fucked, and I say that as someone who had to live through it too, as a fucking adult who \u201cshould know better\u201d. I\u2019m nearly god damn 30 and there\u2019s still nights I wake up, heart racing from nightmares about childhood abuse literally no one saved me from. Not the teachers, not CPS, not the fucking law, not a single individual or institution that was suppose to protect me. We fucked people up for life, convince them they were just unlucky, and then accuse them of the worst possible crime if they try to remove \u201cluck\u201d from the equation. I\u2019m not going to feel like a bad guy for being pissed and trying to do what I know is appreciated beyond my ability to truly understand.

He made Hillary his Secretary of State, and then let her nag him into going to war with Libya. What would be different under President Kamala would be the nature of the anti-Iran propaganda: There would be a lot of emphasis on Iran's oppression of women and the 2022/2023 Protests, and probably lots of kvetching about their persecution of fags as well (remember, it's still Pride Month).

Their uninformed rants about and assaults on Jews drive the creation of \"laws against antisemitism\" which therefore INCREASES state repression against not only them, but against everyone else! They're the reason \"anti-Zionism is antisemitism\". Their crude Julius Streicher (lowest IQ of all Nazis, sitting at 106) antisemitism is used by Zionists/Likudniks to JUSTIFY Israel continuing to not only exist as it is (as a militarized, racist practically genocidal neo-Fascist state), but to become even more militarist! Indeed, many Likudnik types actually USE crude antisemitic tropes themselves to wind people up! That should make WN/NNs pause and think, but, of course, it doesn't. Finally, their antisemitism itself most likely comes from pro-Russian spheres of online influence ops. The \"Protocols of Zion\" were a Russian invention designed to legitimize separation and subsequent repression of Jews and the primacy of the Orthodox Russian Imperial state. As I posted recently, this Russian \"state-backed antisemitism\" LITERALLY CREATED Zionism in response (every action has an equal and opposite reaction). Furthermore, Russian (White) emigres were behind the formation of the National Socialists in Germany. They were the ones who inserted the idea that all Communists were Jewish. The purpose of that was to destroy the USSR, to remove the Jews from Russia, and to restore the old antisemitic Tsarist state (White Russians FOUGHT FOR the Nazis!).

I don't even think they'd give nukes to Hezbollah, and I don't even see them ever nuking Israel (due to the Islamic holy sites found in that country, and Israel's retaliatory capabilities). Iran's nuclear weapons would be for deterrence and self-defense purposes, nothing more.

The reason for this is most likely to do with how their religion is their race, and their race is their religion. No other group on the planet has a similar identity. Africans were animists when they were enslaved by the (Muslim) Arabs and (Christian) Europeans. They had to be converted to Abrahamism, and then \"assimilated\" (even though this did not really work in either the Arab or European case). They're the only group that can't be \"integrated\" in a way that would make sense to people. \"Integration\"/autonomy for Jews means the \"Pale of Settlement\", the \"Jewish Oblast\" or funny hats or Star of David patches. They have to be fully assimilated into the overall identity to be both guaranteed protection, as well as (ironically) to be prevented from engaging in subversion (why would they subvert their own and only identity?).

What on earth could possess someone to think it\u2019s acceptable to hurl a tin at an MP (or, indeed, anyone?). Huxley knew.

{"clean_text": "Hersh\u2019s scenario sounds like a pretty garden variety Neocon fantasy. Here\u2019s a pertinent excerpt: American investigative journalist Seymour # Hersh in his latest Substack article wrote: A major U.S. bombing campaign against Iran is expected to begin as early as this weekend, according to (his trusted) Israeli and American sources. Approved by the # Trump administration, the strikes will focus on key military and # nuclear infrastructure, including the fortified Fordow facility, where Iran\u2019s most advanced centrifuges are located deep underground. The delay in timing, Hersh reports, is due to Trump\u2019s desire to avoid disrupting U.S. # markets when trading opens Monday. The operation goes beyond targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities\u2014it aims to destabilize the country's leadership. # US and Israeli planners are counting on internal unrest to break out, hoping that strikes on military bases, police stations, and administrative centers will incite broader opposition. Hersh says there are even unconfirmed reports that Ayatollah # Khamenei may have left # Tehran . While some in # Washington favor installing a moderate religious figure to lead the country in a transitional phase, Israeli officials reportedly reject this, pushing instead for full political control through a loyal replacement. These internal disagreements reflect a deeper divide over what post-strike Iran should look like. Intelligence circles are also looking to Iran\u2019s ethnic minorities\u2014particularly Azeris with alleged # CIA ties\u2014as potential tools to spark wider dissent. The plan, according to Hersh, bears resemblance to previous Western interventions in # Libya and # Syria , where external pressure led to long-term instability and suffering. The attack on Iran, he warns, could have similar consequences, potentially fragmenting the country and inflaming the region\u2014all while being driven by Netanyahu\u2019s strategic aims and Trump\u2019s desire for a major geopolitical \u201cwin.\u201d p/seymour-hershs-iran-scenario # USPol # Israel # iran # war", "mentions": [], "hashtags": ["# Hersh", "# Trump", "# nuclear", "# markets", "# US", "# Khamenei", "# Tehran", "# Washington", "# CIA", "# Libya", "# Syria", "# USPol", "# Israel", "# iran", "# war"], "links": ["https:// meaninginhistory.substack.com/", "https://f.cz/tags/CIA", "https://f.cz/tags/Hersh", "https://f.cz/tags/Israel", "https://f.cz/tags/Khamenei", "https://f.cz/tags/Libya", "https://f.cz/tags/Syria", "https://f.cz/tags/Tehran", "https://f.cz/tags/Trump", "https://f.cz/tags/US", "https://f.cz/tags/USPol", "https://f.cz/tags/Washington", "https://f.cz/tags/iran", "https://f.cz/tags/markets", "https://f.cz/tags/nuclear", "https://f.cz/tags/war", "https://meaninginhistory.substack.com/p/seymour-hershs-iran-scenario"], "emojis": [], "emoji_names": [], "id": "114713919558570192"}

{"clean_text": "TODAY IS JUNETEENTH \"On this day in 1865, enslaved people in Texas were notified by Union Civil War soldiers about the abolition of slavery. This was 2.5 years after the final Emancipation Proclamation which freed all enslaved Black Americans. But Slavery continued\u2026 AFRICAN & BLACK HISTORY @AfricanArchives In 1866, a year after the amendment was ratified, Alabama, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Florida, Tennessee, and South Carolina began to lease out convicts for labor. This made the business of arresting black people very lucrative, thus hundreds of white men were hired by these states as police officers. Their primary responsibility being to search out and arrest black peoples who were in violation of \u2018Black Codes.\u2019 Once arrested, these men, women & children would be leased to plantations or they would be leased to work at coal mines, or railroad companies. The owners of these businesses would pay the state for every prisoner who worked for them; prison labor. It\u2019s believed that after the passing of the 13th Amendment, more than 800,000 Black people were part of that system of re-enslavement through the prison system. The 13th Amendment declared that \"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\" (Ratified in 1865) It says, \u201cneither slavery nor involuntary servitude could occur except as a punishment for a crime\".:exclamation_question_mark::exclamation_question_mark: Lawmakers used this phrase to make petty offenses crimes. When Blacks were found guilty of committing these crimes, they were imprisoned and then leased out to the same businesses that lost slaves after the passing of the 13th Amendment. This system of convict labor is called peonage. The majority of White Southern farmers and business owners hated the 13th Amendment because it took away slave labor. As a way to appease them, the federal government turned a blind eye when southern states used this clause in the 13th Amendment to establish the Black Codes. In South Carolina, if the parent of a Black child was considered vagrant, the judicial system allowed the police and/or other government agencies to \u201capprentice\u201d the child to an \"employer\". :exclamation_question_mark:\" #Juneteenth #USHistory #Racism #Racist", "mentions": [], "hashtags": ["#Juneteenth", "#USHistory", "#Racism", "#Racist"], "links": ["https://spinster.xyz/tag/juneteenth", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/racism", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/racist", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/ushistory", "https://x.com/AfricanArchives/status/1935759602659852735"], "emojis": [":exclamation_question_mark:", ":exclamation_question_mark:", ":exclamation_question_mark:"], "emoji_names": ["exclamation question mark", "exclamation question mark", "exclamation question mark"], "id": "114713336331919580"}

We need a radically different approach in this country whereby (1) rape gang members with dual nationality are instantly deported, (2) rape gang members are given life sentences, and (3) the criminal justice system is radically overhauled so that DEI, which is an openly biased political ideology, is removed from this system.

{"clean_text": "Dr. Charlotte Proudman @drproudman \"Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is on trial for racketeering, sex trafficking, and transporting women for prostitution yet he's in court beaming with joy and making heart gestures like it's a fan meet-and-greet. Johnny Depp, a found wife-beater, strutted into court like it was a movie premiere with adoring fans by his side. Meanwhile, Amber Heard had to use a side entrance just to enter the court building\u2014because she was the victim. She didn't receive adoration or applause. She wasn't met with fans holding signs of support. Instead, she was vilified, mocked, and harassed\u2014 online and in person\u2014while Johnny Depp, a man found guilty by the UK High Court to have assaulted her, was cheered on like a rockstar. The hypocrisy is staggering. A woman speaks out about abuse, and she becomes public enemy number one. A powerful man is accused of male violence, and he becomes a martyr, a meme, a hero. This is the culture we live in\u2014one that hates women for surviving and rewards men for abusing. Then there\u2019s Andrew Tate and Tristan Tate grinning and posing outside court. And Russell Brand smirking for the cameras while under investigation for multiple allegations of sexual violence. This is not justice, it\u2019s performance. A carefully staged spectacle where powerful men accused of abuse are treated like celebrities, not defendants. They try to charm the media, rally their fans, and turn courtrooms into platforms to boost their public image. For celebrity men, court is another performance. For survivors, it\u2019s a public spectacle of their trauma. \" #SeanCombs #Diddy #JohnnyDepp #AndrewTate #TristanTate #RussellBrand #RapeCulture #BelieveWomen #EndMaleViolence #MediaAccountability #MisogynyIsViolence #StopGlamorisingAbuse #FeministJustice #PowerProtectsPower #JusticeForSurvivors #TraumaIsNotEntertainment #CelebrityViolence #HoldThemAccountable #TimesUp #MeToo #SurvivorsDeserveBetter #NoMoreSilence #EndRapeCulture #StopVictimBlaming #IntersectionalFeminism #StopMisogyny #WomensVoicesMatter #EndSexualViolence #SmashThePatriarchy", "mentions": [], "hashtags": ["#SeanCombs", "#Diddy", "#JohnnyDepp", "#AndrewTate", "#TristanTate", "#RussellBrand", "#RapeCulture", "#BelieveWomen", "#EndMaleViolence", "#MediaAccountability", "#MisogynyIsViolence", "#StopGlamorisingAbuse", "#FeministJustice", "#PowerProtectsPower", "#JusticeForSurvivors", "#TraumaIsNotEntertainment", "#CelebrityViolence", "#HoldThemAccountable", "#TimesUp", "#MeToo", "#SurvivorsDeserveBetter", "#NoMoreSilence", "#EndRapeCulture", "#StopVictimBlaming", "#IntersectionalFeminism", "#StopMisogyny", "#WomensVoicesMatter", "#EndSexualViolence", "#SmashThePatriarchy"], "links": ["https://spinster.xyz/tag/andrewtate", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/believewomen", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/celebrityviolence", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/diddy", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/endmaleviolence", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/endrapeculture", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/endsexualviolence", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/feministjustice", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/holdthemaccountable", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/intersectionalfeminism", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/johnnydepp", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/justiceforsurvivors", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/mediaaccountability", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/metoo", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/misogynyisviolence", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/nomoresilence", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/powerprotectspower", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/rapeculture", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/russellbrand", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/seancombs", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/smashthepatriarchy", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/stopglamorisingabuse", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/stopmisogyny", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/stopvictimblaming", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/survivorsdeservebetter", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/timesup", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/traumaisnotentertainment", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/tristantate", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/womensvoicesmatter"], "emojis": [], "emoji_names": [], "id": "114706416432741389"}
