{"clean_text": "The Labour Party has been at the forefront of this grand displacement activity for 25 years now. When Ann Cryer, the then Labour MP for Keighley, began raising the alarm in the early 2000s, she was slammed as \u2018dangerous and irresponsible\u2019 by Shahid Malik, a member of Labour\u2019s National Executive and a veteran of the Commission for Racial Equality. When Rotherham MP Sarah Champion spoke up in 2017, years after the horrific abuse in her constituency had first been uncovered by Norfolk in The Times, she was drummed out of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet. Only a few weeks ago, Labour frontbencher Lucy Powell was on Radio 4 blithely dismissing the rape gangs as a \u2018dog whistle\u2019. This is who Labour is now. The so-called party of the people threw working-class communities under the bus because it didn\u2019t want to be called racist, or have to rethink its liberal-elite orthodoxies. No political party comes out of this scandal well. The Tories had 14 years to instigate the national inquiry they are now trying to take credit for. But the grooming-gangs scandal has certainly revealed the particular depths of Labour\u2019s neglect of, and contempt for, ordinary Brits, white British and Pakistani alike. They treated the white working class as a pogrom in waiting. They presumed Pakistani Brits to be paedophile apologists who couldn\u2019t possibly be expected to help root out this cancer at the margins of their communities.

Between 2018 and 2024, 100 councils reported 37,536 monitored cases - with victims as young as 8 years old. This is the tip of the iceberg. Why? Many councils just do not have the reporting systems in place. Of the 379 councils surveyed, just 70 had the means in place to report on \u201cgang/group based CSE\u201d. Just nine councils were able to provide information on the ethnicity of perpetrators. Nine. This patchwork, inconsistent, politically correct approach to data has been going on for decades. And it all serves one purpose: to avoid uncomfortable truths. We are calling for: - A national data standard for all councils and police forces - enforce it - Collection of ethnicity, nationality, immigration status and more - Clear tracking of victim age, gender, ethnicity, and status in care - Mandatory collection of data on group offending - Transparency on how many reports were ignored or downplayed If we can track potholes, school attendance and recycling bins - then we can track child rape.

{"clean_text": "Grooming gangs inquiry: how will it help victims and affect the law? A \u2018vigorous approach to righting wrongs of the past\u2019 is needed along with tougher laws for crimes against children \"Yvette Cooper has condemned damning failures by the authorities to protect children from grooming gangs as she announced there would be a formal requirement on police for the first time to collect ethnicity and nationality data for all cases of child sexual abuse and exploitation. The home secretary confirmed the government would accept all 12 recommendations of Louise Casey\u2019s rapid review, including setting up a statutory inquiry into institutional failures, marking a significant reversal after months of pressure on Labour to act. In her rapid review, Lady Casey found evidence of \u201cover-representation\u201d of Asian and Pakistani heritage men among suspects in local data \u2013 collected in Greater Manchester, West and South Yorkshire \u2013 and criticised a continued failure to gather robust data at a national level. She found evidence that some authorities refused to take into account the ethnicity of offenders out of fear of appearing racist, and said \u201cblindness, ignorance, prejudice, defensiveness and even good, but misdirected intentions, all played a part in this collective failure\u201d. \u201cWhile much more robust national data is needed, we cannot and must not shy away from these findings, because, as Baroness Casey says, ignoring the issues, not examining and exposing them to the light, allows the criminality and depravity of a minority of men to be used to marginalise whole communities,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThe vast majority of people in our British, Asian and Pakistani heritage communities continue to be appalled by these terrible crimes and agree that the criminal minority of sick predators and perpetrators in every community must be dealt with robustly by a criminal law.\u201d The law will be strengthened so that any individual convicted of sexual offences would be excluded from the asylum system and denied refugee status, after the Casey review uncovered cases involving suspects who were asylum seekers. There would also be a legal change so that adult men who have penetrative sex with 13- to 15-year-olds would receive the most serious rape charges. \u201cThe sexual exploitation of children by grooming gangs is one of the most horrific crimes. Children as young as 10 plied with drugs and alcohol, brutally raped by gangs of men and disgracefully let down again and again by the authorities who were meant to protect them and keep them safe,\u201d Cooper told MPs. \u201cThose vile perpetrators who have grown used to the authorities looking the other way, must have no place to hide,\u201d she added, as she offered an unconditional apology to victims from current and past governments. \u201cThese findings are deeply disturbing, but most disturbing of all, as Baroness Casey makes clear, is the fact that too many of these findings are not new. We have lost more than a decade. That must end now.\u201d Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters In her statement, the home secretary criticised organisations which for decades had \u201clooked the other way\u201d instead of protecting vulnerable children, many of whom were singled out for grooming, while their perpetrators walked free. The Home Office will now commission new research into the cultural and social drivers of child sexual exploitation, misogyny and violence against women and girls. The National Crime Agency, the UK\u2019s top investigative body, has been tasked with leading a coordinated national push to reopen historic group-based child sexual abuse cases and identify offenders who slipped through the cracks of previous police efforts. More than 800 cases have now been identified for formal review, with the figure expected to rise above 1,000 in the coming weeks. Further local investigations will be directed and overseen by a national commission with statutory inquiry powers, which will be time limited and, Cooper said, challenge continued denial, resistance and legal wrangling among local agencies.\" #GroomingGangs #ChildSexualAbuse #PornCulture #AntiMAP #MaleSexualDepravity #MaleSexualPolitics #OpPedo #OpPedoHunter #GROOMERS #LeaveThoseKidsAlone #ChildSexTrafficking #RadicalFeminism #RadFem #Feminism #Feminist #EpsteinFiles #PrinceAndrew #JeffreyEpstein #OpPedo #OpPedoHunter #GROOMERS", "mentions": [], "hashtags": ["#GroomingGangs", "#ChildSexualAbuse", "#PornCulture", "#AntiMAP", "#MaleSexualDepravity", "#MaleSexualPolitics", "#OpPedo", "#OpPedoHunter", "#GROOMERS", "#LeaveThoseKidsAlone", "#ChildSexTrafficking", "#RadicalFeminism", "#RadFem", "#Feminism", "#Feminist", "#EpsteinFiles", "#PrinceAndrew", "#JeffreyEpstein", "#OpPedo", "#OpPedoHunter", "#GROOMERS"], "links": ["https://spinster.xyz/tag/antimap", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/childsextrafficking", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/childsexualabuse", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/epsteinfiles", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/feminism", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/feminist", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/groomers", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/groominggangs", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/jeffreyepstein", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/leavethosekidsalone", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/malesexualdepravity", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/malesexualpolitics", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/oppedo", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/oppedohunter", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/pornculture", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/princeandrew", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/radfem", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/radicalfeminism", "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/16/grooming-gangs-report-national-inquiry-victims-law-changes"], "emojis": [], "emoji_names": []}

{"clean_text": "JILLIAN MICHAELS: Why I, a gay woman, can't celebrate Pride Month now that it's been hijacked by leather daddies, drag shows and corporate stunts \"When I was a teenager in the '90s, being gay meant living with shame, not pride. It meant keeping your truth under wraps to avoid being bullied, rejected, or worse. Back then, gay rights weren't just limited, they were almost nonexistent. We couldn't marry. We couldn't adopt. Most of the country still associated us with AIDS. You were a punchline at best, a pervert at worst. Being gay wasn't cool \u2014 it was dangerous. So yes, I understand how Pride started. I understand why it mattered. The original Pride wasn't a party, it was a protest. It grew out of the Stonewall Uprising in 1969, when brave gay men and women finally said, 'Enough.' They fought back against brutality, against invisibility, against erasure. Pride parades became a vehicle for visibility, a way to commemorate those lost to hatred, disease, and silence. It was defiance in the face of rejection. It was necessary. Being gay isn't a merit badge \u00bf it's a fact of my existence. And that's why I've always had a complicated relationship with Pride Month. Being gay isn't a merit badge \u2014 it's a fact of my existence. And that's why I've always had a complicated relationship with Pride Month. The original Pride wasn't a party, it was a protest. The original Pride wasn't a party, it was a protest. I'm all for sexual liberation, but not on a sidewalk in broad daylight with families in the crowd. But that was then. This is now. Today, gay people can marry. Adopt. Run for office. We have legal protections and public support that would have been unthinkable when I came out. Many LGBTQ individuals are not just tolerated, they are embraced, celebrated, and platformed. In some circles, they are practically untouchable. And still, Pride Month has ballooned into a 30-day spectacle that now feels less about unity and more about domination \u2014 cultural, corporate, and political. Let's be honest. This isn't 1992 anymore. We're not fighting for survival. We're fighting for relevance \u2014 and it shows. Pride Month today has become a lightning rod, not because gay people are asking to be treated equally, but because the month has become synonymous with shock value, sexual exhibitionism, and corporate hypocrisy. We've all seen the footage. Leather daddies in assless chaps simulating sex acts in public. Drag queens twerking in thongs in front of children. Parades that look more like adult fetish conventions than civil rights celebrations. I'm all for sexual liberation, but not on a sidewalk in broad daylight with families in the crowd. Keep your kink \u2014 straight or gay \u2014 in private where it belongs. We're told Pride is about 'inclusion,' but increasingly it feels like a middle finger to anyone who doesn't co-sign every fringe performance or ideology. If you so much as raise an eyebrow at what's happening on your city's main street, you're labeled a bigot, even if you're gay yourself. You don't have to be a conservative Christian mom to think that maybe the Pride movement has lost the plot. What's worse, Pride has become corporatized to hell. Every June, major brands roll out rainbow flags like seasonal decor. You can't walk through a Target without being bombarded by LGBTQ-themed merch \u2014 not just for adults, but now for toddlers and babies, too. Meanwhile, some of these same companies have no problem doing business in countries where homosexuality is punishable by death. It's not activism. It's marketing \u2013 and it's insulting. We're told Pride is about 'inclusion,' but increasingly it feels like a middle finger to anyone who doesn't co-sign every fringe performance or ideology. Every June, major brands roll out rainbow flags like seasonal decor. You can't walk through a Target without being bombarded by LGBTQ-themed merch. Even the most well-intentioned people, those who once marched beside us for equal rights, are starting to feel alienated. I don't blame them. They didn't fight for this so that kids could be exposed to sexually explicit performances at public libraries or pride parades that make Mardi Gras look modest. They fought for fairness and dignity. We say Pride is about belonging, but today it often looks more like tribalism, where every dissenting voice, even from within the community, is vilified. And ironically, it's made Pride more divisive than ever. Instead of inviting people in, we're pushing them out. Instead of celebrating how far we've come, we're flaunting how little we care about what anyone thinks, even if it undermines our own cause.\" Archived: #GayPrideMarch #GayHistory #Lesbians #LesbianHerstory #NoKinkAtPride #Pride2025 #LGBWithoutTheT #DropTheT #GetTheLOut #AntiKink #AntiMAP #PornCulture #MaleSexualDepravity #MaleSexualPolitics", "mentions": [], "hashtags": ["#GayPrideMarch", "#GayHistory", "#Lesbians", "#LesbianHerstory", "#NoKinkAtPride", "#Pride2025", "#LGBWithoutTheT", "#DropTheT", "#GetTheLOut", "#AntiKink", "#AntiMAP", "#PornCulture", "#MaleSexualDepravity", "#MaleSexualPolitics"], "links": ["https://archive.ph/s9X9s", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/antikink", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/antimap", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/dropthet", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/gayhistory", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/gaypridemarch", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/getthelout", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/lesbianherstory", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/lesbians", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/lgbwithoutthet", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/malesexualdepravity", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/malesexualpolitics", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/nokinkatpride", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/pornculture", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/pride2025", "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14814341/JILLIAN-MICHAELS-gay-woman-pride-month-hijacked.html"], "emojis": [], "emoji_names": []}

And the reality is that, even though youth attraction is likely quite common? It's simply more socially acceptable to hate kids than to love kids. Society, especially in the US, encourages people to hate their spouses, hate their kids, and hate their neighbors. Et cetera. And all of that is reflected not just through fiction, but also in what forms of fiction are allowed to flourish. The fact that fiction featuring younger characters, whether erotic in nature or not, is increasingly stigmatized, restricted and censored?

While the Republicans hold majorities in both the House and the Senate, the bill only passed the House by 1 vote last time, and several Republicuck senators have already signaled they will vote against it should it pass the House.

{"clean_text": "Thinking about how physical violence could be a valid method of small scale interpersonal conflict solving. Not in the sense of allowing others obliterate someone out of their weight class or as an immediate or frequent means of working on an issue\u2026 But in like, as a way to let others get some shit out of their system and/or to convey emotions that words alone can not, so that the following conversations can be had with more civility. As the initial physical confrontation gave catharsis and/or literally smacked the apathy/indifference/superiority off someone and forced them to pay more attention (ideally). Again, it shouldn\u2019t be a first resort and sometimes it should not be applied, and especially overdone, because it literally hurts others\u2026 But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s always an invalid strategy, specifically amongst individuals who are already at least somewhat familiar/communal or against individuals who have repeatedly shown they will not listen to words and/or actively egg on a fight while being too much of a coward to take the first swing (because they\u2019re aware whoever swings first will be viewed as the less reasonable party, but if that\u2019s not automatically the case\u2026) A personal example I can give if that one time, over the course of weeks, I was struggling with a decaying friendship that ultimately led to that friend coming to my house to formally end our friendship. I had no words for the absolute nerve of that move, and as they went to leave, I trailed behind them to turn them back around so I could slap them as my send off. As I immediately broke down in tears afterwards and shamefully walked my ass back inside, they did not return any response, they just picked up their glasses off the ground and continued leaving. I could have maybe tried to give them an ear full about why I was so offended or how hurt I was, but a slap summarized all of that, and the lack of response implied that it was understood I was upset, but their decision was final. Simply walking away was the equal and opposite wordless exchange, because they also could have spent time verbally explaining that, but it wasn\u2019t necessary and frankly if they had, it would have given the impression they were open to more discussion (especially while I was in a very emotional state). Like sometimes wordless exchanges are genuinely the more effective way of communicating the idea(s) to someone.

He was attacked by the Shia fundamentalists (future Khameneists) for being a \"Communist\" (irony). He assumed \"dictatorial powers\" in order to push through his policies that actually favored the Iranian people. This is what led to the coup against him (sponsored by the U.S. and Britain). This coup brought the repressive dictatorial Sha to power, whose repression led to the 1979 Revolution which led to what we see today.

{"clean_text": "UCU academics oppose Glasgow Uni trans rights consultation \"Lecturers at Glasgow University have been cautioned against participating in a staff consultation on the Supreme Court\u2019s gender rights ruling. An email sent to members of Glasgow\u2019s University and College Union (UCU) branch states that the consultation, organised by the university\u2019s Equality and Diversity Unit, has \u201ccaused distress and fear\u201d for trans and non-binary staff and students. The review of the institution\u2019s gender policies is being carried out in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling on the legal definition of a woman in late April. In the wake of the judicial decision, which ruled that the term \u2018woman\u2019 derives its legal definition from biological sex, not gender identity; transgender women have been banned from a range of female-only toilets and sports teams, including at the Scottish Parliament. The email, sent last Thursday, reads: \u201cCommunication with our membership is already evidencing that this consultation is causing distress and fear for trans, nonbinary and other gender diverse staff and students, by exposing them to scrutiny and debate about their rights, and requiring them to feel obliged to respond in defence of those rights \u2013 rights that the University is already on record as stating it supports as \u2018an inclusive community\u2019. \u201cWe recommend that UCU members do not respond to this consultation until we can issue further guidance. We are also preparing to ask UofG EDU to cancel this consultation and to discuss with us better ways of supporting staff and students around the Supreme Court decision. \u2022'Hostile and discriminatory': Students speak out over trans rights row \u2022MSPs express 'deep concern' over Holyrood trans toilet ban \u2022Top Scottish universities to review trans policies after Supreme Court ruling The communique goes on to state that the UCU \u201cunequivocally\u201d promotes the rights of trans and nonbinary staff and students, adding: \u201cWe believe that this type of consultation on the rights of marginalised groups increases their marginalisation, severely impacts their wellbeing and safety, and does not provide a sound basis for determining policy or practice. \u201cHuman rights are not up for debate. It also increases the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty that has already been engendered by the Supreme Court ruling.\u201d A spokesperson for campaign group For Women Scotland has hit out at the union, telling The Herald: \u201cUCU appears to inhabit an alternate reality where universities can pick and choose which laws they obey. It benefits none of their members if the union or the university stick their fingers in their ears like a petulant toddler. It also reflects poorly on their capacity to understand pretty basic concepts. \u201cThis is not a consultation on rights, it is about the application of the law. Women who understand the reality of sex-based violence and discrimination and work at the university also have human rights, and it may astonish the UCU to learn that they also have a responsibility to represent those members as well as the select elite they prefer to pander to.\u201d Meanwhile, Helen Joyce, director of advocacy at human rights charity Sex Matters, said the \u201cera of no debate\u201d was over. She told The Herald: \u201cGender ideologues\u2019 attempts to thought-police and silence gender-critical academics in recent years have been shameful. It\u2019s hard to understand how this can continue even after the Supreme Court judgment. \u201cThis letter raises an obvious question: what is UCU Glasgow afraid of? Could it be that it cannot counter gender-critical arguments on their merits, and must resort to shunning and ostracism instead?\u201d The academic union is no stranger to facing criticism over its position on trans rights. Two university lecturers behind the gender-critical film Adult Human Female recently sued the UCU over claims they had been discriminated against because of their views. Dr Deirdre O\u2019Neill of Hertfordshire University, and Michael Wayne of Brunel University, told the Employment Tribunal that the union\u2019s public opposition to the film amounted to unlawful discrimination. Members of the UCU Edinburgh branch objected to the film being shown on campus in 2022 and 2023 over \u201cmisinformation\u201d relating to trans and nonbinary people. However, in a ruling handed down this week, a judge dismissed the claim, ruling that the pair had not been treated detrimentally under the Equality Act 2010.\" Archived: #WomenWontWheesht #ForWomenScotland #SayNoToSelfID #No2SelfID #GenderRecognitionAct #GRA #NoSelfID #UK #Freespeech #Skeptic #Censorship #LetWomenSpeak #TeamTERF #OccupyWoman #GetMenOut #Freespeech #HoldTheLine #KeepWomensSpacesSingleSex #WomanFace #AbolishSexRoleStereotyping #RadicalFeminism #RadFem #Feminism #Feminist", "mentions": [], "hashtags": ["#WomenWontWheesht", "#ForWomenScotland", "#SayNoToSelfID", "#No2SelfID", "#GenderRecognitionAct", "#GRA", "#NoSelfID", "#UK", "#Freespeech", "#Skeptic", "#Censorship", "#LetWomenSpeak", "#TeamTERF", "#OccupyWoman", "#GetMenOut", "#Freespeech", "#HoldTheLine", "#KeepWomensSpacesSingleSex", "#WomanFace", "#AbolishSexRoleStereotyping", "#RadicalFeminism", "#RadFem", "#Feminism", "#Feminist"], "links": ["https://archive.ph/GDUvf", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/abolishsexrolestereotyping", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/censorship", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/feminism", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/feminist", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/forwomenscotland", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/freespeech", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/genderrecognitionact", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/getmenout", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/gra", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/holdtheline", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/keepwomensspacessinglesex", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/letwomenspeak", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/no2selfid", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/noselfid", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/occupywoman", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/radfem", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/radicalfeminism", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/saynotoselfid", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/skeptic", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/teamterf", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/uk", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/womanface", "https://spinster.xyz/tag/womenwontwheesht", "https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25231999.ucu-academics-oppose-glasgow-uni-trans-rights-consultation/"], "emojis": [], "emoji_names": []}
