To use the content viewer, execute the following command:


```
python -m data.content_viewer --input data/second_stage_classification/racist_posts.jsonl --output data/second_stage_classification/clean_posts.jsonl
```

you can replace the input with any jsonl file and get only the content back to facilitate reading.
